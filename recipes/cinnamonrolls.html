    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cinnamon roll recipe starts with an easy dough made in your bread machine, and the rolls take just 15 minutes to bake in your oven. With a sweet cinnamon, sugar, and pecan filling and a decadent cream cheese frosting, they taste just like the ones sold at that well-known store in the mall.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon Roll Dough:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>4 1/2 – 5 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (75g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 packets Fleischmann’s® RapidRise® Yeast (about 4 1/2 tsp)</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (355g) water</li>
            <li>6 tbsp (85g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Filling:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup (55g) unsalted butter, room temp</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) light brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Cream Cheese Icing:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>4 oz cream cheese, room temp</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (55g) unsalted butter, room temp</li>
            <li>1 cup (120g) powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon Roll Dough:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a heat-safe bowl, combine the water and butter (cut into tablespoons). Heat in the microwave for 30-45 seconds, until warm to the touch but not hot. The butter will not melt completely. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients along with the egg, and mix with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Add 2 more cups of flour and mix until the mixture turns thick and sticky.</li>
            <li>Add another 1/2 cup of flour and mix again. The mixture should now become shaggy and hard to stir. If it reaches this point, start using your hands to knead the dough, adding another 1/4 cup of flour as needed until the dough becomes a smooth, soft, and slightly tacky mass.</li>
            <li>Test the dough with a clean finger; if it sticks, add another 1/4 cup of flour and knead. If it doesn't stick, shape the dough into a ball and let it rest uncovered for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>After resting, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 10x15 inch rectangle. Spread room temperature butter evenly on the dough, leaving about 1/2 inch border around the edges. Sprinkle with brown sugar, spread it evenly, and then top it with cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into a log starting from the 15 inch side. Compact the log gently by placing your hands at each end and giving it a light squeeze. This brings the log together if it had stretched out during the rolling process.</li>
            <li>Cut the log into 12 pieces, then place the rolls in a buttered or greased 9x13 dish (or two 9" round pans, placing 6 rolls in each). Allow the rolls to rise in a warm spot covered with a towel for 1 hour. If you live in a colder climate, create a warm environment for the rolls by preheating your oven to its lowest setting, turning it off, and then placing the rolls inside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F (remove the rolls if they were proofing inside) and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the tops are a light golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Cream Cheese Icing:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mash together room temperature cream cheese and butter with a fork until combined. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla and continue mashing with the fork until the mixture starts to loosen. At this point, switch to a whisk and mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Spread the icing on the warm rolls. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
